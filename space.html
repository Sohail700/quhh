        <h1>AI, quantum and nuclear technologies are key to Lockheed Martin’s vision for Space 2050 </h1>
        <hr>
        <h3>
          Artificial intelligence, quantum computing and nuclear power are among the key technologies Lockheed Martin sees as important for future space missions.

          Through a project called Destination: Space 2050, Lockheed Martin executives are exploring, for example, how AI could assist scientific exploration of locations where communications with remote sensors would be disrupted by high latency.
        </h3>
        <br>
        <h3>
          In that type of environment, “you really can’t interact with the robotic sensors,” David Lackner, Lockheed Martin senior manager strategy and business development, said during a June 28 webinar. “You have to have something that is super autonomous that can deal with unknown unknowns. We’ve got some really interesting causal autonomy tools that … allow the AI to be super smart about running into something that it hasn’t encountered before.”

          AI also has important applications for remote-sensing data, said Aura Roy, Lockheed Martin deputy program manager for Multi-slit Solar Explorer mission, known as MUSE.

        <h2>Quantum Computing</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>
          In addition, Lockheed Martin’s Space 2050 report focuses on quantum computing, quantum communications and quantum remote sensing, technologies.
          <br>
         “That computing infrastructure utilizing quantum will be there for us in the 2050 timeframe,” Lackner said.
          <br>
          As a result, Lockheed Martin is developing “quantum algorithms to make use of quantum computers, quantum remote sensing and quantum communications,” Lackner said. “Specific space applications of quantum are going to be super enabling for what we want to do.”
